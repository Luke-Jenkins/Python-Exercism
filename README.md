# Exercism - Python Track

The included files are the exercises (and my solutions) from [Exercism's Python Track](https://exercism.io/my/tracks/python). Each directory contains a README from Exercism describing the problem, a test file written by Exercism, and my solution file. The solution files are downloaded from Exericsm and come with a pre-defined function used by Exercism's test file to determine completeness. However, this constitues only the first line of each solution file; all data in the solution files is my own work.
